All graphs should be in the graphs folder and the respective sorted chromosome files are contained in each species folder. 

Review comments by Axelle Weeger

I really liked the way you handled file creation for the 40chromosome files. It's very tidy, and I didn't know you could specify path and name in the same string. 

One thing that I would consider changing is your naming scheme for the data you generate within your environemnt. Once the entire script ran, looking back through the environemnt I can't always tell where a dataframe fits within the script, which I feel would help streamline an at-a-glance review of what you are acheiving with this particular script. 

Overall, I think your script is very tidy, your graphs look good and your final visualization was not something I had though of doing.
